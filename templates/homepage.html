                        <p> Hello! My name is Alberto, I am 23 years old and I am about to finish my Master degree in Computer Science.
                            Therefore, I am currently searching for a job, hence the creation of this small humble website.
                            <br><br> During my bachelor and masters, I’ve developed  a special interest towards app and game development and I consider those to be my main passions in the area.
                            In my future job, my main goal is to evolve both professionally and personally. I consider myself an ambitious hardworking person that gives his best to solve any adversity that may arise.
                            I constantly seek to acquire new knowledge on areas of my interest, so I can improve my skills and fulfill my quest for professional success.
                            <br><br>During my free time I love to go outside and, if possible, travel. Since I was a kid, photography
                            has always been a passion of mine so it’s pretty common to see me along side a camera.
                            Apart from photography, climbing is my other passion. I started this hobby a bit over 2 years ago
                            and, since then, I do my best to climb twice or thrice a week.
                            <br><br>But enough about my interests. Let's take a look at some actual work that I've developed throughout
                            the years.

                        <p> Game design and development is a passion I discovered during my Master degree. It all started as pure curiosity and ended up being my area of specialization.
                            <br>In total, I've done three game development related courses during my Master degree: Game Design, Game Development Methodology and Virtual Reality.
                            <br>All of these courses allowed me to learn and improve my skills in the area, each in its own way. Additionally, my master thesis also required me to develop a game from scratch which ended up being tested by over 50 people.
                            <br>Below you can find a small portfolio with some of the games I developed throughout the years.

                                     <p> LootMachinaX was the first 3D game I developed for a course called Game Design.
                                         They gave us the freedom to create a game within the theme "Ex-Lootbox". From there, I created a game where the goal was for the player to find different loot boxes scattered around map, while exploring a 3D environment. These boxes contained different augmentations (e.g. "super jump", "rush", "break crystals") for the main character, allowing him to reach areas of the map that were previously impossible.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>This course and the development of this game made me realize that Game Development is one of my biggest passions in this area, since I often found myself happy to think I was going to work on this game.

                                    <p> The Island was a game created in the context of the Game Development Methodology course I took during my Master degree. Along side a small team of colleagues, we developed a 3D low poly style game that explored the basic concepts of a survival game such has harvesting materials, hunting animals, gathering resources and exploring.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The course was more focused on the whole game development experience, i.e., from early scratches and brainstorm to competition and domain analysis. Therefore the game itself focused basic survival game mechanics.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>We had the privilege to work closely with two art students who developed specific assets for our game and helped us improve the overall look and feel of the game environment. Getting to work on this game with a team from distinct backgrounds was a great learning experience.

                                     <p>Way out is a 3D low poly puzzle game where you play as a golem who just woke up and is trying to figure out the purpose of his existence.  To do so, he has to solve certain puzzles and challenges in different rooms and environments to find clues about himself and the reason of his embodiment.

The puzzles that the golem has to solve throughout the game were actually created by the golem himself, while he still embodied his human form. They are a way of validating whether the golem’s cognitive and reasoning abilities are compatible with those of normal humans and if the transmutation occurred flawlessly.

                        <p> Game design and development is a passion I discovered during my Master degree. It all started as pure curiosity and ended up being my area of specialization.
                            <br>In total, I've done three game development related courses during my Master degree: Game Design, Game Development Methodology and Virtual Reality.
                            <br>All of these courses allowed me to learn and improve my skills in the area, by using tools such as Unity and Blender. Additionally, my master thesis also required me to develop a game from scratch which ended up being tested by over 50 people.
                            <br>Below you can find a small portfolio with some of the games I developed throughout the years.

                                    <p> The Island was a game created in the context of the Game Development Methodology course I took during my Master degree. Along side a small team of colleagues, we developed a 3D low poly style game that explored the basic concepts of a survival game such has harvesting materials, hunting animals, gathering resources and exploring.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The course was more focused on the whole game development experience, i.e., from early scratches and brainstorm to competition and domain analysis. Therefore the game itself focused basic survival game mechanics.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>We had the privilege to work closely with two art students who developed specific assets for our game and helped us improve the overall look and feel of the game environment. Getting to work on this game with a team from distinct backgrounds was a great learning experience.
